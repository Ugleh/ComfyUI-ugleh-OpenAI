# Contributing

Thanks for contributing!

## Dev setup

- Use the same Python environment that runs ComfyUI.
- Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Adding nodes

- Prefer exposing OpenAI APIs as composable primitives.
- Keep node UIs predictable (dropdowns for enums, multiline for text, sane defaults).
- Update README + CHANGELOG for user-facing changes.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused and easy to review.
- Include a short description and (if applicable) screenshots of the node UI.
